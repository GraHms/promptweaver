# Enhanced Error Handling Implementation

## Summary of Changes

We've implemented the following error handling improvements:

1. **Detailed Error Types**
   - Created custom error types in `errors.go`
   - Added position tracking (line/column) to all errors
   - Included context about surrounding content for better debugging

2. **Error Recovery Strategies**
   - Implemented `RecoveryMode` option (StrictMode and ContinueMode)
   - Added hooks for custom error recovery logic via `ErrorHandler`
   - Supported partial results even when errors occur

3. **Validation Hooks**
   - Created a `Validator` interface and `ValidatorRegistry`
   - Implemented regex-based content validation
   - Added support for custom validation functions

4. **Context-Aware Error Messages**
   - Included line numbers and positions in error messages
   - Added suggestions for fixing common errors
   - Provided context about the surrounding content

All tests are now passing, and we've provided comprehensive documentation in the `ERROR_HANDLING.md` file.
